print
single or double quotes but stay consistent
input
print() for a blank line, \n for a line break in-line
print for debugging (like console.log)
# for comments
cmd+/ to comment/uncomment
ctrl+l to clear terminal
clear variables, underscores, lowercase first_name last_name
text transform
  sentence = 'The rabbit is named Pepper'
  print(sentence.upper())
  print(sentence.lower())
  print(sentence.capitalize())
  print(sentence.count('a'))
can't print numbers and strings together
numbers can be stored as strings
numbers stored as strings are treated as strings
input always returns strings
int converts to integer (whole number)
float converts to a floating number
number values are used for math operations and to specify indivudal rows and lists and arrays
to get date and time use datetime library
  from datetime import datetime
  current_date = datetime.now()
  print('Today is ' + str(current_date))
timedelta is used to define a period of time
use date functions to control date formatting
sometimes you receive the date as a string and need to convert it to a datetime object
make sure to set up error handling for date data
error handling is not debugging
  syntax errors 
    --code not going to run at all, 'good' errors, you 'want' these
  runtime errors 
    --code will fail when run (like division by 0), decent errors
    --with a runtime error, the problem is somewhere with YOUR code
  catching runtime errors (try/except/finally is not used to find bugs; you don't have to catch all errors -let it bubble up, someone else will deal with it, the app will crash (sometimes, this is exactly what you want to happen))
    try:
      print(x / y)
    except ZeroDivisonError as e:
      #optionally log e somewhere
      print('Sorry, something went wrong')
    except:
      print('Something really went wrong')
    finally:
      print('This always run on success or failure')
  logic errors 
    --won't run at all, no error message, just doesn't do as expected (or anything)
    Stack trace
      last calls are on the top
      your code is liekly on the bottom
      seek out line numbers
    Finding your mistake
      reread your code
      check the doc
      search the integertake a break
      ask someone for help
**unit testing and test-driven development --research/learn about **
be careful when comparing strings
strong comparisons are case sensitive
elif is great if only one of the conditions will ever be met
if you have a list of possible values to check, you can use the IN operator
UNIT TESTING
Test every possible condition!
Sometimes you can combine conditions with AND instead of nesting if statements
If you need to remember the results of a condition check later in your code, use Boolean variables as flags (honour_roll = True then later if honour_roll:)
lists are like arrays in JS; zero-indexed; store anything, store any type
  movies = ['Scoob', 'Sonic', 'Alice In Wonderland']
  actors = []
  actors.append('Bruce Lee')
  actors.append('Jada Pinkett')
  print(movies)
  print(actors)
  print(actors[1])
arrays need a library imported; not like JS (other than being zero-indexed);  number based, must all be the same type
  from array import array
  scores = array('d')
  scores.append(97)
  scores.append(98)
  print(scores)
  print(scores[1])
common operations
  names = ['Susuan', 'Christopher']
  print(len(names)) # get the number of items
  names.insert(0, 'Bill') #insert box before index
  print(names)
  names.sort() #smallest to largest or abc *modifies the list*
  print(names)
retrieving ranges
  names = ['Susuan', 'Christopher', 'Bill', 'Justin']
  presenters = names[1:3]
  # start and end index
  print(names)
  print(presenters)
dictionaries - key/value pairs, storage order not guaranteed
  person = {'first': 'Christopher'}
  person['last'] = 'Harrison'
  print(person)
  print(person['first'])
lists - zero-based index, storege order guaranteed
decision depends on whether or not you want to name things, and if you need a specific order
cmd+d seek-multi-select
loop
  for name in ['Christopher', 'Susan']:
    print(name)
looping a number of times --use range
  for index in range(0,2):
    print(index)
looping with a condition **This is not a typical example loop of a while loop (you want to use while in situations where something is going to change automatically. A list like this is almost always better to use a for list).
  names = ['Christopher', 'Susan']  
  index = 0
  while index < len(names) :
      print(names[index])
      # Change the condition!!!
      index = index + 1
functions
    use functions instead of repeating code
        import datetime
        def print_time():
            print('task completed')
            print(datetime.datetime.now())
            print()
        print_time()
By moving the code to a function, you reduce rework and the chance of introducing bugs when you change the code you had copied
    # Import the datetime class from datetime library
    from datetime import datetime 
    # Print the current time
    def print_time():
        print('task completed')
        # Now I don't need the extra datetime prefix
        print(datetime.now())
        print()
What if I want a different message displayed? Pass parameters for a lot more flexibility
    def print_time(task_name):
        print(task_name)
    print_time('first name assigned')
ex #2
    def get_initial(name)
        initial = name[0:1].upper()
        return initial

    first_name = input('Enter your first name ')
    first_name_initial = get_initial(first_name)

    last_name = input('Enter your last name ')
    last_name_initial = get_initial(last_name)
    print('Your initials are: ' + first_name_initial + last_name_initial)
functions that return values allow clever code but you might trade readability for less code
    def get_initial(name)
        initial = name[0:1].upper()
        return initial

    first_name = input('Enter your first name ')
    last_name = input('Enter your last name ')

    print('Your initials are: ' + get_initial(first_name) + get_initial(last_name))
functions can accept multiple parameters
you can specify a default value for a parameter
  ex: def get_initial(name, force_uppercase=True):
          if force_uppercase:
            initial = name[0:1].upper()
          else: initial = name[0:1]
          return initial
      first_name = input('Enter your first name: ')
      first_name_initial = get_initial(first_name)

you can also assign the values to parameters by name when you call the function
  positional notation, or name notation (when called ex name=first_name) that parameters can be used in any order

  ex: def get_initial(name, force_uppercase=True):
          if force_uppercase:
            initial = name[0:1].upper()
          else: initial = name[0:1]
          return initial
      first_name = input('Enter your first name: ')
      first_name_initial = get_initial(forced_uppercase=False, name=first_name)

      print('Your initial is: ' + first_name_initial)

Packages and modules

[Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) allow you to store reusable blocks of code, such as functions, in separate files. They're referenced by using the `import` statement.

import module as namespace
import helpers
helpers.display('Not a warning')

import all into current namespace
from helpers import *
display('Not a warning')

import specific items into current namespace
from helpers import display
display('Not a warning')

Packages

[Distribution packages](https://packaging.python.org/glossary/#term-distribution-package) are external archive files which contain resources such as classes and functions. Most every application you create will make use of one or more packages. Imports from packages follow the same syntax as modules you've created. The [Python Package index](https://pypi.org/) contains a full list of packages you can install using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

Virtual environments

[Virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/venv.html) allow you to install packages into an isolated folder. This allows you to better manage versions.

APIS
You can call functions called by other programs hosted on web servers. [Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner) contain a number of APIs you can call from your code to add intelligence to your apps and websites.

Requirements for calling an API:

- [API Key] to give you permission to call the API
- Address or Endpoint of the service
- function name of method to call as listed in the [API documentation]
- function parameters as listed in the [API documentation]
- HTTP Headers as listed in the [API documentation]

Many APIs return data in [JSON](https://json.org/), JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a standard format that can is readable by humans and parsed or generated by code. 

JSON is built on two structures:
- collections of key/value pairs
- lists of values

JSON Linters will format JSON so it easier to read by a human. The following website have JSON linters:
- [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/)
- [ConvertJson.com](http://www.convertjson.com/jsonlint.htm)
- [JSON schema linter](https://www.json-schema-linter.com/)

Python includes a [json](https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html) module which helps you encode and decode JSON

Creating JSON object
# Create a dictionary object
person_dict = {'first': 'Noel', 'last':'Arzola'}
# Add additional key pairs to dictionary as needed
person_dict['City']='Boaz'

# Convert dictionary to JSON object
person_json = json.dumps(person_dict)

# Print JSON object
print(person_json)

Use print statement to help you debug your code
Use linting and have a print out of the full JSON so you can figure out the structure when reading specific elements

Decorators =)
Used most commonly to add additional functionality to your code

Programming components:
Objects > Nouns, Data constructs
Functions/Methods > Vebrs, Actions
Decorators > Adjectives, Add additional functionality to code, Common in frameworks (Django, Flask)

``` python
# Example decorator
@log(True)
def sample_function():
    print('this is a sample function')
```
