# Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are an open source web application that allows you to create and share Python code. They are frequently used for data science. The code samples in this course are completed using Jupyter Notebooks which have a .ipynb file extension.

- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) to install Jupyter so you can run Jupyter Notebooks locally on your computer
- [Jupyter Notebook viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to view Jupyter Notebooks in this GitHub repository without installing Jupyter
- [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/) to create a free Azure Notebooks account to run Notebooks in the cloud
- [Create and run a notebook](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/notebooks/tutorial-create-run-jupyter-notebook?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner) is a tutorial that walks you through the process of using Azure Notebooks to create a complete Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates linear regression
- [How to create and clone projects](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/notebooks/create-clone-jupyter-notebooks?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner) to create a project
- [Manage and configure projects in Azure Notebooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/notebooks/configure-manage-azure-notebooks-projects?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner) to upload Notebooks to your project

# Anaconda

Anaconda is an open source distribution of Python and R for data science
Includes: 
  more than 1500 packages
  a graphical interface called Anaconda Navigator
  a command line interface called Anaconda prompt
  a tool called conda

conda is a tool to create and manage python environments
As you get into more advanced Python coding you will need to install different packages
When working wth tools such a Jupyter notebooks, conda may be the simplest way to install libraries so they can be accessed from your notebooks

After you install Anaconda launch the prompt

Create a virtual environment with conda: conda create --name my_notebook_env python=3.7 -y
  --name my_notebook_env = the name of the environment
  python 3.7 = version of python in the environment
  -y responds yes automatically to prompts

Activate your virtual environment

conda activate my_notebook_env

conda deactivate 
# will deactivate the current active environment

conda remove --name my_notebook_env --all
# will permanently delete the virtual environment

Install library in the active environment

conda install pandas

Install jupyter
conda install jupyter

conda list
# will return a list of installed libraries

Launch notebook from the activate environment
1. Activate your environment
  conda activate my_notebook_env
2. Launch Jupyter notebooks
  jupyter notebook

cmd/ctrl+c twice will shut down the kernel and bring back the prompt
NOTE: You may need to deactivate and reactivate your environment before you launch Jupyter notebooks the first time after you install a new packages

# Pandas
An open source/BSD-licensed library
High performance and familiar data structures and data analysis tools
https://pandas/pydata.org
import pandas as pydata

pandas Series is similar to Python list
One dimensional array of objects
Each row as an index
By default, index is zero-based
The difference is we can set the index to whatever we want!

Create a new Series
airports = pd.Series([
            'Seattle-Tacoma', #0
            'Dulles', #1
            'London Heathrow' #2
            'Schiphol' #3
          ])
airports[2] # 2 - 'London Heathrow'

for value in airports:
    print(value)

DataFrame for two dimensional data structures
Similar to a table in a database or spreadsheet
Columns identified by name
Rows of data
Index column

Create a DataFrame
airports = pd.DataFrame([
  ['Seattle-Tacoma', 'Seattle', 'USA'],
  ['Dulles', 'Washington', 'USA']
])

columns parameter to specify column names
airports = pd.DataFrame([
  ['Seattle-Tacoma', 'Seattle', 'USA'],
  ['Dulles', 'Washington', 'USA']],
  columns=['Name', 'City', 'Country']
  )
